This folder contains variant catalogs that can be used with [ExpansionHunter](https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunter) to 
genotype 59 disease-associated loci in short read data aligned to either the GRCh38 or the GRCh37 genome. 

These files were also used to generate the [gnomAD STR callset](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/short-tandem-repeats?dataset=gnomad_r3)
described in more detail [here](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2022-01-the-addition-of-short-tandem-repeat-calls-to-gnomad/).
